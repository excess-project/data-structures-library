INSTALL
-------

1. Configure the install prefix in the top-level Makefile.

2. make install

See the Makefile and the examples directory for examples of how to setup the
macros and compiler flags needed for building an application that includes the
data structures library and its dependencies.

To compile the test program in the examples directory:

Without optional dependencies:
$ g++ -o queue_test -fopenmp -DUSE_OPENMP -I /opt/EXCESS/include/ dsl-test.cpp

With Intel TBB support enabled:
$ g++ -o queue_test -fopenmp -DUSE_OPENMP -DUSE_TBB -I /opt/EXCESS/include/ -ltbb  dsl-test.cpp
